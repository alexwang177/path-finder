This project is a simulator built in React that helps to visualize various pathfinding algorithms.

Live Demo: 

## Features

### `Pathfinding Algorithms`

These algorithms find a path from a start node to an end node.

- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bidirectional Search

### `Maze generation`

These algorithms generate a maze that will make the pathfinding more interesting.

- Recursive Maze Generation
- Vertical Skew
- Horizontal Skew

### `Obstacles`

Add custom walls to act as obstacles.
